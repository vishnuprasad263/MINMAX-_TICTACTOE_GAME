## Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Minimax Algorithm Readme File

### Introduction

This readme file provides an overview of the Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using the Minimax algorithm. The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in game theory to determine the optimal move in two-player games. In the context of Tic-Tac-Toe, the Minimax algorithm allows an AI player to make strategic moves and play against a human opponent.

### 1. Installation

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game with the Minimax algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the game repository from the provided source.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x recommended).
3. Install the required dependencies, if any (mentioned in the repository's documentation).
4. Run the game script to start playing.

### 2. Game Rules

The game of Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking empty cells with their respective symbols. The goal is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three symbols before the opponent does. The symbols used are typically "X" for the first player and "O" for the second player.

### 3. Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm used to determine the best possible move in a game by considering all possible moves and their outcomes. It works by assuming that both players play optimally and aims to minimize the maximum loss ("minimize the maximum regret").

In the context of Tic-Tac-Toe, the Minimax algorithm evaluates the game state by assigning a score to each possible move. It recursively explores all possible moves and builds a game tree until it reaches a terminal state (win, lose, or draw). It then assigns a score to each terminal state and backtracks to select the move with the maximum score for the maximizing player (AI) and the minimum score for the minimizing player (human opponent).

### 4. Usage

To play the Tic-Tac-Toe game against the AI player using the Minimax algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Run the game script.
2. The game will display an empty 3x3 grid.
3. Enter your moves by specifying the row and column numbers (e.g., "1 2" for the first row, second column).
4. The AI player will automatically make its move using the Minimax algorithm.
5. Continue playing until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.



### 5. Conclusion

The Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using the Minimax algorithm provides an enjoyable and challenging gaming experience. By following the installation steps and understanding the game rules and Minimax algorithm, players can test their skills against an intelligent AI opponent. Customization options allow for further exploration and enhancement of the game's features. Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
